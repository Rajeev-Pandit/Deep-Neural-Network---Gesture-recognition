# Deep-Neural-Network---Gesture-recognition

A deep neural network to develop a feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. 

Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).
